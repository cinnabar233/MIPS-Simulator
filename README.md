# MIPS-Simulator
A MIPS simulator implementing a subset of MIPS instructions, DRAM and Non-Blocking Access using C++. <br>
The program STANDARD_DRAM.cpp takes a set of MIPS instructions as input and outputs a complete execution log. <br>
The program NON_BLOCKING_ACCESS.cpp does the same but more efficiently.
